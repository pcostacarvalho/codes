# codes
scripts created to automate tasks


at_converte.sh: converts the format of the at file to new format from the RS-LTMO-ASA code

commands-create-input.sh: creates the input files jfile and dm adapted to the spin dynamics code (UppASD)

commands-dm.sh: changes the dm file to the appropriate format

commands-jfile.sh: changes the jfile to the appropriate format

dot_product.py: calculate the dot product between two sets of vectors to verify the Moryias' rule, i.e., Rij.Dij = 0

fix_posfile.py : rearrange the atomic position of posfile

make_inclu_files.ipynb: create the inclu files with a set of atomic position chosen within a determined distance

make_par.sh: creates the uppar and dwpar (with the potential parameters) files for RS-LMTO-ASA

plot-jds.sh: plot the interactions Jij and Dij 

rotate_cluster.py: rotates the geometry of a cluster of atoms

split-files.sh: split the interactions Dij for specific couplings

wigner_seitz_radius.f95: calculates the Wigner Seitz Radius according to the lattice paramter and crystalline structure given by the user.
